bio: |-
  I have been working on infrastructure and technology for national and
  international brands for over 8 years. Working with the likes of KFC / BT /
  Pearson / NetSend / Lendy and others. I have a deep
  understanding of the importance of scalable, reliable code and infrastructure, and
  use that knowledge to ensure the best system possible is planned and developed
  from the start of a project.
